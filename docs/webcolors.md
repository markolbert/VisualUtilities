# WebColors

The `WebColors` class contains various static methods supporting frequently-used transformations between "web-encoded" colors and colors as defined in the Microsoft/Windows environment (the difference relates to how RGB colors are stored within a 32 bit integer value). Using the Google Earth API within a Windows app is an example of where this difference comes into play.
